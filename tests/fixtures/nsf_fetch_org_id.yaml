        is a critical resource for society, but information related to its use is
        limited. The goals of this research are to improve our understanding of where
        and how much groundwater is used. The research outcomes will be directly relevant
        to water managers, irrigators, and policy makers, benefiting society. The
        PI will use Hydrologic Sciences Workshops and Scientist Spotlight activities
        to integrate research into the education of undergraduate students and into
        the training of a graduate student. The integrated research and education
        plan will enhance partnerships with state water agencies and produce data
        products\u2014groundwater well classifications by the geologic formation they
        tap, and estimated groundwater use\u2014that will enhance infrastructure for
        research. The data products have the potential to improve existing water storage
        and depletion tools, models, and assessments that rely on water-use data to
        constrain water availability, contributing to broader policy discussions.
        Through this work, the PI will build upon her track record of science communication
        by broadly disseminating her research in general media outlets through short
        videos designed to engage the public and policy makers with scientific findings.
        The research prioritizes scalable methodologies and dissemination of scientific
        methods and outputs through open access repositories, which will enable further
        research beyond the expected outcomes from this work. \\r\\n\\r\\nHumans dominate
        critical components of the hydrosphere, but their impact is challenging to
        quantify. In the western United States, where direct human impacts on the
        terrestrial water cycle are expected to be pronounced, the extraction and
        integration of data from human systems is critical to characterizing hydrologic
        fluxes. Using the western United States as a case study, this work will integrate
        large datasets from human systems with more traditional information used in
        the hydrologic sciences to meet the following objectives: (i) characterize
        groundwater wells by the geologic formation they tap; (ii) quantify groundwater
        withdrawals for irrigated agriculture; and (iii) integrate research with planned
        educational activities that synergistically train undergraduate students and
        simultaneously produce research outputs. The research will take a convergent
        approach, combining the PI\u2019s training in hydrology, water-resources engineering,
        big-data analytics, and water law to improve understanding of the hydrological
        cycle by characterizing human access to groundwater. This research has the
        potential to improve existing tools, models, and assessments of storage and
        depletion that rely on understanding human impacts on the terrestrial water
        cycle and that rely on water-use data to constrain water availability.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis
        proposal is co-funded by the Hydrologic Sciences and Education and Human Resources
        programs in the Division of Earth Sciences.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis award reflects
        NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
        using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\",\"agency\":\"NSF\",\"awardAgencyCode\":\"4900\",\"awardeeAddress\":\"3227
